        <p>The whole report will be divided into three separate articles.</p>
<p>At first I will introduce sterilization and Biology Indicator.</p>

<p>Here are the four ways usual hospital used in their everyday work, you can find that the sterilization is the most difficult process and it can be used in the preparation before the surgery.</p>
<p> The most important thing  is</p>

<p>Now let us invite our major role, the product of the company.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgchr.com/i/yusiQ0"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/02/02/yusiQ0.jpg" alt="yusiQ0.jpg"></a></p>

<p>The picture above shows the competitor of the product, 3M has a monopoly in this industry, however the price of it is very expensive at present. Luckily, once our new product goes into the market, their monopoly will end. Because emerging products have many superior features and advantages, including cheaper price.</p>
<p>You can definitely find that the indicators have two different coloues. In fact, the difference between them is the time required for inspection.</p>
<p>Compared with the blue bottles, the yellow are much more faster. It takes it only 3 hours to give out the results, while the traditional blue needs approximately 48 hours.</p>

        <p>Since November 1, 2020, Nanjing has begun to enforce garbage classification, and residential areas have started to put garbage into designated places. It was expected that citizens would be dissatisfied with this regulation, but in fact, it did not make people complain like Shanghai before, and people accepted this regulation and actively carried out garbage classification. </p>
<p>So how should we practice garbage classification in schools?<br>First of all, it is natural to start from the individual. We should have a sense of classification in our hearts. For example, we should prepare garbage bags by ourselves, place them in a unified way, and clean the garbage at the garbage dropping point at a fixed time every day.</p>
<p>Second is to strengthen education, campus often waste generated in the limited range, is just some used waste paper, snack bags, cans, yogurt, milk cartons, if you do not know what these respectively belong to waste, can search, or use the class meeting to get to know, so that it can achieve the campus of garbage classification.</p>
<p>Moreover, the unique classification method of each class. Buying small sorting garbage cans is the most common method. In this way, in the process of throwing garbage, people’s classification consciousness can also be strengthened and thinking can be triggered.</p>
<p>Finally is to everyone’s initiative, separate garbage is not a person, is a collective, garbage sorting is easy, but you always worry about this matter, not a I literally throw that’s all right, anyway, nobody knows what is I throw, classification is a sanitation worker or the helper, if so, class’s and grade’s garbage classification must do bad, regular appraisals garbage classification can improve class honor outstanding class and the desire to do it well.</p>

        <p>Dear all</p>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I am a student from PAL2. And now I am glad to write you an email about my plans during the three years in Jinling High school.</p>
<p>I will divide my plans into three main parts.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong>    <strong>PAL</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong>    Schoolwork and IELTS</p>
<p>Try to adapt the new environment and the study condition. I did not do well in the September monthly test, and I think the most important things I need to do is make progress in the coming Mid-term test. I plan to attend the firs IELTS exam next summer since I think I need to prepare a lot. For next year I will attend the IGCSE test.</p>
<p>\2.    Club</p>
<p> I think I should put my effort in some meaningful clubs, so I only attend three clubs. I will take part in the FBLA exam and I am also a member of Model United Nations. Another club is just for fun, I choose it through my interest. Moreover I plan to be a volunteer in the Mingxiaoling Museum and I have already passed the first test.</p>
<p>\3.    Extra part: I plan to do a further study in social psychology and attend the reading seminar.</p>
<p>Also I want to join the Student Union.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong>    <strong>AS</strong></p>
<p>\1.    Schoolwork </p>
<p>Attend AS test.</p>
<p>Also I plan to attend a biology test in AQA system and get the score.</p>
<p>\2.    Club</p>
<p>Start a club of my own. </p>
<p>\3.    Extra part: Complete the draft of recommendation letter. Choose the university and major. (Initial thoughts: UK UCL&amp;LSE Biomedical engineering&amp; biomedical science&amp; Psychology) </p>
<p><strong>3.</strong>    <strong>A2</strong></p>
<p>\1.    Schoolwork</p>
<p>Prepare the application materials, plan the exams and ask the foreign teachers to estimate the grades.</p>
<p>\2.    Apply for a university</p>
<p>Decide which school you want to go to, then pay the deposit and apply for a visa.</p>
<p>​                                </p>
<p>​                                     </p>

        <p>咖啡总结</p>
<p>我们的咖啡一共有三种，分别是纯拿铁，抹茶拿铁，草莓拿铁，比较意外的是抹茶拿铁卖的最好，其实一开始打算多做草莓拿铁的，草莓也准备了很多，可以做装饰。至于价格，真的是非常便宜，纯手工咖啡，高品质牛奶和配料这个给了我十足的信心。</p>
<p>出现情况是因为一开始销售不佳，半天才卖出去几杯，然后我就开始思考，首先是调低定价，然后再加上用喇叭喊，在校园里四处游荡，最终卖的还是不错。</p>
<p>最令人高兴的还是大家的高评价，很多老师也品尝了咖啡，并且给出了赞扬。我很享受美食节这个活动，也希望以后可以推出更多高品质美食。</p>
<p>There are three kinds of coffee, namely plain latte, green tea latte and strawberry latte. Surprisingly, green latte is the best seller. In fact, at the beginning, we planned to make more strawberry latte, but we also prepared a lot of strawberries, which can be used as decoration. As far as the price is concerned, it is really very cheap. Handmade coffee, high quality milk and toppings give me full confidence.</p>
<p>What happened was that the sales were not good at the beginning, and only a few cups were sold in half a day. Then I began to think, first of all, I lowered the price, and then I used the loudspeaker to shout and walk around the campus, and finally the sales were still good.</p>
<p>The most gratifying thing was the high comments from everyone. Many teachers also tasted the coffee and gave their praise. I really enjoyed the festival and I hope there will be more high-quality food in the future.</p>

        <p>A short introduction</p>
<p>Speaking of me, the first thing that comes to mind when describing myself is that I am really ordinary. This means I have many common hobbies like others and do not always enjoy the success in my life. But failure sometimes can teach me more. Therefore, this is the reason why persons like me always keep trying which seems they never give up.</p>
<p>However, almost everyone have different opinions on me. Some teachers say that I am a quiet and shy, but those who know me well will not agree. In fact, I am outgoing and helpful.</p>
<p>I like to do a variety of activities. For instance, I like playing the piano and also listening to music. In addition, I spend some time listening to music. Moreover, I have a good sense of humorous so people never feel bored with me. I am full about the unknown since it is the main way that people learn the world.</p>
<p>Next, My proudest moment was passing my level 10 piano exam when I was in fourth grade at primary school; it took me three months to prepare for and I worked very hard. In general, it only takes me three months to get such a brilliant grade. Because my parents promised to give me a puppy as a gift if I achieved excellence, it was like working hard for my dream. When I passed the exam, I was extremely proud of this achievement and it demonstrated that I was determined and able to achieve goals and win the thing I prefer most.</p>
<p>This is me, a special and normal girl.</p>

Maybe there is something different between the two ethnic groups. There were people whose religion, culture, habits are all different. However they had to live in the same area which could not make both two agree with the other. Another important reason was due to the United Nations. As we all know one of the duties is prevent fighting and violence from happening, but it did not finish the job well. The United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) had been in Rwanda since October 1993, with a mandate to oversee the implementation of the Arusha Accords. UNAMIR’s Chapter VI mandate rendered it powerless to intervene militarily, and most of its Rwandan staff were killed in the early days of the genocide, severely limiting its ability to operate. UNAMIR was therefore largely reduced to a bystander role, and Dallaire later labelled it a “failure”.(From Wikipedia)</strong></p>
<p><strong>And now we need to talk about the genocide in two concepts. One is the realism, which emphasizes competition and conflict in international relations. The state is the major role and also the justice and theoretical ethics.. Otherwise, liberalism emphasizes cooperation and morality in international relations. In this perspective, a country is a collection of different domestic social interest groups.</strong></p>
<p>**The cause of the ethnic conflict can be contributed to the competition between the two different national in the same state. It involves national security interests and power disputes at the same time. The event turned violent because there was no peaceful solution.</p>

<p>This is also my first time to be a volunteer, like most student, I also feel a little nervous.<br>Am I qualified for the job?<br>Will people be satisfied with my service?With an uneasy mood, I walked to the door of the Ming Xiaoling Museum.<br>I, together with two a-level student. Our job are selling the guides and giving out the questionnaires.<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgchr.com/i/0aYvVK"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/07/0aYvVK.jpg" alt="0aYvVK.jpg"></a></p>
<p>We can change our job for several times during the three hours period.<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgchr.com/i/0aYz5D"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/07/0aYz5D.jpg" alt="0aYz5D.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The museum is so small that I can go through all the galleries in five minutes. I handed out the questionnaire, running in each galleries again and again, upstairs and downstairs, just to find more people. The visitors were also very understanding, and they were generally willing to take a few minutes to fill out a questionnaire. Although the problems are not very interesting and attractive at all.<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgchr.com/i/0aYxUO"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/07/0aYxUO.jpg" alt="0aYxUO.jpg"></a></p>
<p>We finally succeeded in distributing 130 questionnaires, which was also appreciated by teachers.<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgchr.com/i/0aYXb6"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/07/0aYXb6.jpg" alt="0aYXb6.jpg"></a></p>
<p>I felt so happy and proud too.</p>

<p>The simple sentences touched me a lot. Sometimes, I’m in the same satuiation as Julie, the major role of the novel flipped .</p>
<p>One of my teacher said that this word can be used to describe the egg in the pan. That was so interesting, with the sound of hot oil, maybe you can also image something interesting when you read these sentences.</p>

It was on a big vacant lot,  giving shade in the summer and a place for birds to nest in the spring.  It had a built-in slide for us, too. Its truck bent up and around in almost a complete spiral,   and it was so much fun to ride down. My mom told me she thought the tree must have been damaged as a sapling but survived,  and now, maybe a hundred years later, it was still there, the biggest tree she’d ever seen. “A testimony to endurance”  is what she called it.</em></p>
<h5 id="A-discussion"><a href="#A-discussion" class="headerlink" title="A discussion"></a>A discussion</h5><p>I had an interesting argument with my parents, the phare <em>sycamore</em> has more than one meaning. It represents two different trees. One is wuhuaguo tree in Chinese, and the other is wutong tree. The bilingual translated it into the first meaning，but my parents do not agree，common sense told them people cannot climb on the wuhuaguo tree since they are too tiny.</p>
