Maybe there is something different between the two ethnic groups. There were people whose religion, culture, habits are all different. However they had to live in the same area which could not make both two agree with the other. Another important reason was due to the United Nations. As we all know one of the duties is prevent fighting and violence from happening, but it did not finish the job well. The United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) had been in Rwanda since October 1993, with a mandate to oversee the implementation of the Arusha Accords. UNAMIR’s Chapter VI mandate rendered it powerless to intervene militarily, and most of its Rwandan staff were killed in the early days of the genocide, severely limiting its ability to operate. UNAMIR was therefore largely reduced to a bystander role, and Dallaire later labelled it a “failure”.(From Wikipedia)</strong></p>
<p><strong>And now we need to talk about the genocide in two concepts. One is the realism, which emphasizes competition and conflict in international relations. The state is the major role and also the justice and theoretical ethics.. Otherwise, liberalism emphasizes cooperation and morality in international relations. In this perspective, a country is a collection of different domestic social interest groups.</strong></p>
<p>**The cause of the ethnic conflict can be contributed to the competition between the two different national in the same state. It involves national security interests and power disputes at the same time. The event turned violent because there was no peaceful solution.</p>
